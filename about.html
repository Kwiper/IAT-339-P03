                <p>Hey! I'm Jonathan, a game designer, programmer, musician, whatever you need me to be. I aim to create interesting visual and interactive experiences through digital mediums!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've been making games since I was 15, working on several game jams and mods with my friends and on my own, before pursuing game design as a career. I am currently studying Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University, with a concentration in Media Arts. I previously worked at <a href="https://www.ludare.com" class="text-link">Ludare Games</a> as a junior game designer. I am also a member of SFU's <a href="https://sfugamedev.club" class="text-link">game development club</a>, where I've helped club leaders run workshops teaching people various aspects of game development!</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I'm not making games you can probably find me... playing games. Or making music. And being a student, I suppose...</p>
